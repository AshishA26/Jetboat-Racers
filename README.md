# Jetboat-Racers
## Description
Jetboat Racers is a multiplayer boat racing game with thrilling arcade physics, stunning environments, and many tracks to put your skills to the test.

This is a personal project I have been working on as a solo dev for nearly a year. It uses Unreal Engine 5, Autodesk Maya, and Adobe Substance 3D Painter.

Available soon on Steam.
